## Street Easy Linear Regression project
StreetEasy is New York City’s leading real estate marketplace — from studios to high-rises, Brooklyn Heights to Harlem.

In this project i will analyse:
- “Does having a washer/dryer in unit increase the price of rent?”
- “How costly is living by a subway station in Brooklyn/Queens?”
- “Is a tenant over or underpaying?”

And create a Linear Regression model to predict the rent for the futures real states

In this project i used the libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SKlearn
